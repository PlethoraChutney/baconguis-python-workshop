                        Someone buys your carrot. How can you remove it from your stock
                        object so that nobody tries to buy what you don't have?

                    <p>
                        Congratulations! You've secured some venture capital funding!
                        You can now afford to stock more than one of each type of produce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With your new capital, you buy three apples, ten bananas, six
                        carrots, and ninety-seven durians.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It would be nice to keep track of each item, and how many you have.
                        How would you change your stock object (if at all) to accomplish this?

                            Wow, your shop is doing really well now that you can have more than one
                            of everything. However, customers are annoyed that it takes you a long time to figure out
                            how much their order costs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It would be nice if you could access the price
                            using the name of the item instead of having to look them up in the table
                            below.

                    <p>
                        Write some code which will check the stock of each produce item,
                        and then print out the total value for that type of produce! Then
                        print the sum of all your investments.
