# store guests in a list
guests = [
    'Jeff Rosenstock',
    'Phoebe Bridgers',
    'Stefan Babcock',
    'Maria Maita-Keppeler',
    'Rod MacKinnon',
    'Marie Curie (ghost)'
]

# import the randint function
from random import randint

# store the menu in a dictionary
#
# Same rationale as last week --- the guests are independent,
# no other data associated with them. However, there's a natural
# association between an item and its price. Hence, a key: value
# pair.
menu = {
'Skaghetti': 13.12,
'(Sad and) Hot Dish': 14.99,
'Robot Writes a Menu': 21.99,
'Road Dog': 7.99,
'French Fries (extra salty)': 6.99,
'Radium (do not eat)': 10.99
}

# make list of menu items for convenience
#
# Bonus Info: Don't worry if it's confusing ----------------------
# |
# | menu.keys() returns a "dict_keys" object, which is a type of
# | generator, and essentially acts as a "set", another type we haven't
# | talked about.
# | 
# | However, unlike a real set, dict_keys objects cannot
# | be accessed by index, so we have to convert it to a list in order
# | to pick a random menu item.
# | 
# | If we just wanted to iterate over the menu items, we could
# | use menu.keys() as-is. Additionally, in practice, if you try
# | to iterate over a dictionary you'll iterate over the keys by default,
# | so list(menu) would work. But it's best to be explicit when teaching.
# | 
# End bonus info --------------------------------------------------

menu_items = list(menu.keys())

# for each guest:
# 
# Reminder: this means that through every loop, the current guest
# we're "thinking about" will be stored in the `guest` variable.
for guest in guests:

    # take their order
    # 
    # subtract 1 from length becasue randint is inclusive,
    # and len gives the number of elements, not the index
    # of the last element. Zero indexing!
    order = menu_items[randint(0, len(menu_items) - 1)]

    # if a living person ordered radium, kindly ask them to pick
    # something else
    # 
    # I use a while loop here because we're picking randomly. That
    # way if a non-ghost picks radium twice or more in a row we'll
    # catch it. Using an if: statement would only catch it the first
    # time.
    while guest != 'Marie Curie (ghost)' and order == 'Radium (do not eat)':
        print(guest + ', please pick another order.')
        order = menu_items[randint(0, len(menu_items) - 1)]

    # then we print the name, order, and price.
    print(guest + ' ordered ' + order + ' which costs $' + str(menu[order]))

# extra credit: what would the output be if we had put the print()
# statement here, outside the loop, instead of in the loop?
