        For practice, I thought we could do something a bit practical now
        that we've built up some skills. I'd like you to try to write
        a python script which processes a STAR file. You can download that
        file <a href="example.star">here</a>.
    </p>

        What's a STAR file?
    </p>
    <div class="solution no-show" id="starfile">
        <p>
            STAR files are a text archive format. RELION uses them for particle coordinates,
            angles, and other info. A brief description of the standard:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Any line starting with <span class="fake-code">data_</span>
                is the name of the table
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="fake-code">loop_</span> starts the table
            </li>
            <li>
                Any line starting with <span class="fake-code">_</span> is a column name
            </li>
            <li>
                Any other line is a row, with column entries separated by whitespace.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <p>
        First, read the STAR file into a python object.

    <p class="hint" id="read-in-click">Show how Rich did it</p>
    <div class="solution no-show" id="read-in">
        <pre><code class="language-python">with open('example.star', 'r') as f:
    starfile = list(f)</code></pre>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
    <p>
        Next, create a dictionary where the keys are the column names and the 
        values are a list of entries in that column. I.e., the key
        <span class="fake-code">rlnAngleRot</span> would have the list of all
        particle rotations as its value.
    </p>

    <p class="hint" id="dataframe-breakdown-click">How did Rich break this problem down?</p>
    <div class="solution no-show" id="dataframe-breakdown">
        <p>To solve this problem, we need to do a couple things.</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>
                We need to figure out whether a row is a column name, data
                entry, or something else. So I would start by just printing what
                I think each line is, in order (e.g., 'Table name', 'empty',
                'column name', etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Then we process the row. A column name should be used to create
                a new key/value pair, and a row should be used to add a single entry
                to every value. Remember that in versions >= 3.7, the order of keys
                in a python dictionary is preserved, so no need to worry about order!
            </li>
            <li>
                You may want to consider type here --- if a column is all numbers,
                is it worth converting them here? Or should you only do that if you
                need to? No right answer.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            I could write my own <span class="fake-code">mean()</span> function, but

    <p>Rotate each particle 180&deg; about rlnAngleRot.</p>

    <p class="hint" id="rotation-breakdown-click">How did Rich break this problem down?</p>

        <ol>
            <li>First, we need to convert rlnAngleRot to numbers if it hasn't been already</li>

        <p>
            At this point, I'm used to pulling a column and converting it to a number if necessary.
            There are a few ways to check if a number is greater than 360 and, if so, loop it around.
            You might try googling "python modular arithmetic" to see if there's an easy way.

        Write a new file, <span class="fake-code">rotated.star</span>, with your

    <div class="solution no-show" id="write-breakdown">
        <p>
            This one is trickier than it first seems. We need to consider what a STAR
            file needs to conform to the standard:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It needs to start with <span class="fake-code">data_{table name}</span></li>
            <li>It needs to begin the data block with <span class="fake-code">loop_</span></li>
            <li>
                It needs each column name to be printed on a line,
                prepended with <span class="fake-code">_</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                After all the column names, each row of the data should be printed,
                with entries separated by whitespace.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Since we're only writing the one file, it's okay to do this in your main
            script, but you might consider writing a <span class="fake-code">write_star()</span>
            function for practice 😊
        </p>
        <p>
            So, here's my thinking for this question:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a new file to write to. Call it <span class="fake-code">rotated.star</span></li>
            <li>Write the table name</li>
            <li>Write <span class="fake-code">loop_</span></li>
            <li>
                Write each column name, adding back the <span class="fake-code">_rln</span>
                prefix that I removed when reading the table in
            </li>
            <li>
                Loop over the length of any column (they should all be the same ---
                maybe it's worth checking that they are!) using an integer index
            </li>
            <li>
                For each integer, and each column, write the <span class="fake-code">i</span><sup>th</sup> column
                entry. Separate the entries by a space
